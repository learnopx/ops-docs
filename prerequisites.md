A GNU/Linux machine running a recent distribution is recommended:

* OpenSwitch is developed on Ubuntu. However, Debian, Fedora, SuSe should work fine using the [Linux Setup](linux-setup).

At least 30GB of disk available for each OpenSwitch build directory (usually takes way less, but this is the worst-case scenario).
